<h1>How to use PLink</h1>

<p>PLink draws piecewise linear link projections.  Components
may be points, PL arcs, or PL circles.  Edges are oriented
consistently in each component.  Different components are different
colors.</p>

<p>When using the mouse to draw a link with PLink, you should always
<i>click-and-release</i>.  Do not hold the mouse button down while
drawing.  PLink uses only the left mouse button.
</p>
 
<p>Click-and-release the left mouse button to place a starting vertex
and begin drawing.  The vertex will be connected to the pencil cursor
by a thin red line.  Click-and-release to place a second vertex.  The
two vertices will then be joined by an edge.  Continue to draw other
vertices and edges to your heart's content.</p>

<p>To stop drawing, either click twice on the same vertex to create an
arc, or click on an endpoint vertex.  The latter operation will either
create a circle component or join together two arc components.</p>

<p>To drag a vertex to a new location click-and-release on the vertex.
The vertex will now be enclosed in a circular cursor.  Move it to
where you want it to go and click the left (or middle) button to place
it.  If you drag one endpoint on top of another, they will meld.</p>

<p>To change the orientation of a component, click on one of the edges
in that component, not too close to a vertex or crossing.</p>

<p>The default state of the editor, i.e. neither drawing nor dragging,
is indicated by the arrow cursor.  In this state, clicking on a
crossing will toggle the handedness of the crossing.  Double-clicking
on an endpoint vertex will restart drawing from that vertex.
Double-clicking on a non-endpoint vertex will break the link at that
point and begin drawing with the old incoming edge.</p>

<p>You will not be allowed to create edges that pass too close to a
vertex or a crossing, or to place vertices too close to edges or
to crossings or to other vertices.  If you attempt to do any of these
things, <i>you will be beeped at</i>.</p>

<p>The window can be resized to allow for different sizes of link
projections, and the arrow keys can be used to slide the projection
around in order to make more room on one side or another.</p>

<p>The "Tools" menu can be used to make the projection alternating
(provided that all components are circles), or to clear the screen,
or to reflect the projection in the xy-plane, changing all crossings.</p>

<p>The "File" menu can be used to save the projection as a SnapPea
link projection file.  (This can be done from the drawing state as
well, in which case the "hot vertex" is remembered in the file!).  The
"File->Open File" command will read a SnapPea link projection file,
and restart drawing if the projection was saved while drawing.  The
"File->Export" menu allows the projection to be exported in various
standard formats for describing link projections.</p>

<p>If you are running PLink from inside SnapPeaPython, closing the
window or exiting the program will pass your projection to SnapPea to
have its complement triangulated.</p>
