PLink is a full featured graphical editor for knot and link projections,
using the cross-platform GUI toolkit Tk.  The primary focus is on
piecewise-linear link projections, but it also supports a "smooth
mode" and can export images in PostScript, PDF, SVG, and TikZ formats.

This is a pure Python module and you can install it via
